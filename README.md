# Helm-Kubernetes
# What is Helm
Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes. It works similarly to how apt works on Ubuntu or yum on CentOS. With Helm, you can install, update, and uninstall packages in Kubernetes.

For example, in Linux, if you want to install Python, you can simply run:
```bash
sudo apt install python3
```

In the same way, with Helm you can install Kubernetes controllers and tools such as Ingress, Argo CD, Prometheus, Grafana, or even third-party tools like NGINX.

The advantage of using Helm is that you donâ€™t need to manually go through long documentation or write complex YAML files. Instead, Helm charts handle the configurations for you, making deployment much faster and easier.
