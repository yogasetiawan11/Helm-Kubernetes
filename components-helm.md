# 1. Helm Charts
A Helm chart is a collection of files that describe a set of Kubernetes resources. It acts as a package for your Kubernetes application, similar to a DEB or RPM file in Linux.

# Components of a Chart:
- Chart.yaml: Metadata about the chart (name, version, etc.).
- values.yaml: Default configuration values.
- templates/: Directory containing Kubernetes manifests as templates.
- charts/: Directory for chart dependencies.
- README.md: Optional documentation.

## Creating a Chart:
```bash
helm create myapp
This generates a new chart structure under the myapp directory.
```

## Installing a Chart:
```bash
helm install my-nginx bitnami/nginx
Charts enable you to define complex applications, including deployments, services, config maps, and more, all bundled together for easy management.
```

# 2. Helm Repositories
A Helm repository is a place where Helm charts are stored and shared. It’s similar to a package repository in Linux (like APT or YUM repos).

## Adding a Repository:
```bash
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
```

## Listing Repositories:
```bash
helm repo list
```

## Updating Repositories:
```bash
helm repo update
```

Repositories make it easy to organize, store, and distribute Helm charts, and they support versioning, so you can choose specific versions of a chart to install.

# 3. Helm Releases
A Helm release is a specific instance of a chart that has been deployed to your Kubernetes cluster. You can think of it as a deployed version of your application.

## Creating a Release:
```bash 
helm install myapp ./myapp
```

## Listing Releases:
```bash
helm list
```

## Upgrading a Release:
```bash
helm upgrade myapp ./myapp
```

## Rolling Back a Release:
```bash
helm rollback myapp 1
```

## Deleting a Release:
```bash
helm uninstall myapp
```

Releases are useful for tracking deployed versions, performing rollbacks in case of failures, and managing multiple instances of the same chart.

## Summary
Charts are packages that define Kubernetes resources.
Repositories are storage locations for Helm charts.
Releases are deployed instances of a chart.
